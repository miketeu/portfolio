# PORTFOLIO
### This portfolio has been put together as part of a Boot Camp course to display progress so far.
The code for this site is available under an MIT licence.
This is an ongoing project for the purpose of allowing BootCamp staff to assess progress.

The technologies used are HTML5 and CSS. I have also used Google fonts in order to intall a particular font (Pacifico) in order to attempt to make the 'About Me' section more personal and encourage clicks on the button. The button will eventually, if time permits, cause a modal to pop up with full contact details and maybee!! a link to a chat bot but that is quite a way off.

The included website for Peter Baldwin Accountnta is one that I developed some time ago in exchange for accounting services. The site shows the lack of expertise at the time and I am looking forward to producing more sophisticated work post BootCamp.
